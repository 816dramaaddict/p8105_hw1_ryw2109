```{r HW1Q1, message = FALSE}

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

  # the data in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
    # provides the variable names and 
names(penguins)
    # the first 10 rows of the dataset
unique(penguins)

  # the number of rows in the dataset
nrow(penguins)

  # the number of columns in the dataset
ncol(penguins)

  # the mean flipper length with the removal of null values
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

  # Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help).
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()

  # Export your first scatterplot in your project directory using ggsave.
ggsave ("Bill Length VS Flipper Length.pdf")
```

There is a total of `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns where there exists null values such as NA. The following are the variable names of the dataset:

`r names(penguins)`

There is an average flipper length of `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` mm.
